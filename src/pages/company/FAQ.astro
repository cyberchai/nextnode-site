    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>Are you legally eligible to do business in the US and Canada?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        Yes! All contracts are made with NextNode LLC, a US-registered business. We are also Canadian, so we serve clients across North America. Official responsibilities, both financial and legal, are managed by these entities.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>Do you work with solo creatives like artists, writers, or musicians?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        Totally! Whether you're looking to showcase your art, publish your writing, or share your music with the world, we love helping individuals bring their creative vision online. We can build simple, beautiful sites (like on WordPress or custom platforms) that show you and your work. No business-technical jargon required.
      </p>
    </details>


    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>What does your pay rate look like?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        It depends on the scope and complexity of the project. We offer both hourly and flat-rate pricing. For example, a simple website might start at $500. We’re happy to talk through options during a free consultation and encourage you to use our <a href="/company/costcalculator">cost calculator</a> for a rough estimate.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>What kind of post-deployment support do you offer?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        We offer both ongoing maintenance packages and one-time handoffs with full documentation. It's up to you! Some clients want us to manage it all, others prefer to take over with a clean launch, or we can do a mix of both.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>Do you work with solo founders or early-stage startups?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        Absolutely. We would love to help you get to MVP or create a proof of concept with flexibility in scope and budget.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>Do you collaborate on civic tech or public interest projects?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        We do, and we'd love to do more. If you're working on projects that support communities, promote equity, or improve access to public services, we’re all ears.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>I'm interested in learning web development. Can I work with you?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        Yes! Whether you're just starting out or working on a personal or academic project, we’re happy to collaborate in a way that supports your growth. We welcome hands-on involvement in design, development, research, and storytelling—and we’re open to mentoring, pair programming, or co-creating something together. We’re also flexible around school schedules and gladly work with both technical and non-technical interns.
      </p>
