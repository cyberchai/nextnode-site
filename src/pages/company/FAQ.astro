    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>Are you legally eligible to do business in the US and Canada?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        Yes! All contracts are made with NextNode LLC, a US-registered business. We're also Canadian, so we serve clients across North America. Official responsibilities, both financial and legal, are managed by these entities.
      </p>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>What does your pay rate look like?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        It depends on the scope and complexity of the project. We offer both hourly and flat-rate pricing. For example, a simple website might start at $1,500. We’re happy to talk through options during a free consultation.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>What kind of post-deployment support do you offer?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        We offer both ongoing maintenance packages and one-time handoffs with full documentation. It's up to you—some clients want us to manage it all, others prefer to take over with a clean launch.
      </p>
    </details>

    <details class="faq-item">
      <summary><span>Do you work with solo founders or early-stage startups?</span><span class="plus">+</span></summary>
      <p>
        Absolutely. Some of our favorite projects have started with a simple idea and one driven person behind it. We can help you get to MVP or create a proof of concept with flexibility in scope and budget.
